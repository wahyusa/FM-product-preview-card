## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sveltekit
- TailwindCSS

### What I learned

The srcset attribute from HTML5 is interesting to learn so I can provide multiple image size on specific viewport.

### Continued development

If there is any suggestion I should try that or try with svelte-image plugin
